# Sugar Repairs Module [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/sugarcrm/SugarRepairsModule.svg?token=ApQ7hyuyE1rftpStfgbN&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/sugarcrm/SugarRepairsModule)
This module is designed to help assist with repairing common issues in a Sugar instance. You should always test the repairs against a cloned enviroment before executing on a production instance. This tool is to be used at your own risk.

# Usage
This repo is a module loadable package that can be installed to Sugar through the module loader. Once installed repairs can only be run from the command line. By default, all repairs are run in test mode. Test mode will not make any changes to your system and only output information on changes that will be made. To turn off test mode you will need to pass `--test false` to the cli command.

When testing mode is off, the repair actions will backup any modified tables to `<table name>_srm_<timestamp>`. Any files modified or created will have their contents store in a record under the Sugar Repairs module that you can access through the UI. All log messages will be output to your terminal window as well as stored in the Sugar log file. Any items noted as `[Sugar Repairs][<cycle>][<action>][Change]` are information about file rewrites and database updates. Any items noted as `[Sugar Repairs][<cycle>][<action>][Action]` will require a manual change to correct from a developer or administrator of the system.

##Things to note
* It is highly recommended to remove the Sugar Repairs module before upgrading.
* This package can not be installed to the Sugar On-Demand envrionment by customers as it will not pass package scanner and you will not have direct access to the command line. If you are experiencing an issue with your instance, please open a [support ticket](https://web.sugarcrm.com/support/cases).

##Building Installer Package
To build the installer package, you will need to download the contents on this repository and execute:
```
php build.php
```
Once completed, the installer .zip package will be located under `./builds/`.

##Running Repairs
Repairs will need to be run differently based on your environment and can only be executed from the command line.

##For Local & On-Demand ION
For local instances and ION, you will need to change to the supp_SugarRepairs directory and run the cli.php directly.

###Testing Command
```
cd "modules/supp_SugarRepairs/" && php cli.php --repair <action>
```

###Execute Command
```
cd "modules/supp_SugarRepairs/" && php cli.php --repair <action> --test false
```

##For On-Demand Mothership
For mothership, you will need to change to the instances directory and run shadow-shell:

###Testing Command
```
$options = array('repair' => '<action>');require_once("./modules/supp_SugarRepairs/cli.php");
```

###Execute Command
```
$options = array('repair' => '<action>', 'test' => false);require_once("./modules/supp_SugarRepairs/cli.php");
```



#:wrench: Language Repairs
Corrects common language file issues. The various issues addressed are shown below:

##Testing Command
`cd "modules/supp_SugarRepairs/" && php cli.php --repair lang`

##Execute Command
`cd "modules/supp_SugarRepairs/" && php cli.php --repair lang --test false`

##Issues Addressed
* Health Check Errors:

  * [Health Check Error: Bad vardefs - key] (https://support.sugarcrm.com/Knowledge_Base/Administration/Install/Troubleshooting_Health_Check_Output/Health_Check_Error_Bad_Vardefs_Key/)

  * [Health Check Error: Bad vardefs - multienum] (https://support.sugarcrm.com/Knowledge_Base/Administration/Install/Troubleshooting_Health_Check_Output/Health_Check_Error_Bad_Vardefs_Multienum/)

  * [Health Check Error: Found NULL values in moduleList strings] (https://support.sugarcrm.com/Knowledge_Base/Administration/Install/Troubleshooting_Health_Check_Output/Health_Check_Error_Found_NULL_Values_in_moduleList_Strings/)

* Extra CR/LF issues
If there are extra CR/LF characters between the lines of a language file they will be eliminated.

* Replaces `$GLOBALS` in language files
Any language string that is defined as global is rewritten in place.  This assures that when duplicates are removed the correct value is left behind. The example being that `$GLOBALS['app_list_strings']['key'] = array(…);` will be converted to `$app_list_strings['key'] = array(…);`.

* Duplicate Keys
If an array key appears more than once in any given language file, only the final one will be retained.

* Redefined module list arrays
If the entire module list array is redefined in the language file, it is then written to individual indexes rather than a redefined array. This prevents the system from having undefined modules and issues when deploying new modules through Module Builder. 
```php
$app_list_strings['moduleList'] = array(
    'module1' => 'Module 1'
    'module2' => 'Module 2'
);
```
is converted to:
```php
$app_list_strings['moduleList']['module1'] = 'Module 1';
$app_list_strings['moduleList']['module2'] = 'Module 2';
```
* Flags Errors
If a flag is thrown, manual intervention will be required. Scenarios that can throw flags are listed below:

1. All language files are tested for syntax errors and are flagged if they don’t pass.  
2. Any custom logic hook that contains a modified language key will flagged for manual change.

* Custom Vardef Files are Updated
  * If there is a custom vardef that defines a default value for a field that contains a key that needs to be changed then the VarDef file is updated.
 
* Other custom PHP files
  * If a file contains a string of characters that matches a key that needs to be changed it will be flagged for possible Manual updating in the log. 
 
* Updates the database keys for enum/multienum fields when a correction is made.
* Runs the vardef repair.
* Runs the workflow repair.
* Runs the report repair.
* Runs the process author repairs
